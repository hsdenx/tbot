i2c - I2C sub-system

Usage:
i2c bus [muxtype:muxaddr:muxchannel] - show I2C bus info
crc32 chip address[.0, .1, .2] count - compute CRC32 checksum
i2c dev [dev] - show or set current I2C bus
i2c loop chip address[.0, .1, .2] [# of objects] - looping read of device
i2c md chip address[.0, .1, .2] [# of objects] - read from I2C device
i2c mm chip address[.0, .1, .2] - write to I2C device (auto-incrementing)
i2c mw chip address[.0, .1, .2] value [count] - write to I2C device (fill)
i2c nm chip address[.0, .1, .2] - write to I2C device (constant address)
i2c probe [address] - test for and show device(s) on the I2C bus
i2c read chip address[.0, .1, .2] length memaddress - read to memory
i2c write memaddress chip address[.0, .1, .2] length [-s] - write memory
          to I2C; the -s option selects bulk write in a single transaction
i2c flags chip [flags] - set or get chip flags
i2c olen chip [offset_length] - set or get chip offset length
i2c reset - re-init the I2C Controller
i2c speed [speed] - show or set I2C bus speed
